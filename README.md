## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

#### Required Software:
- **Git**: Install Git on your local machine.
- **Node.js**: Install Node.js (preferably the LTS version).

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

#### Create a Folder:
- Create a folder named `IPMS` on your local machine.

#### Clone the Repository:
- Open the Command Prompt (CMD), navigate to the `IPMS` folder, and run:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IPMS-Project/IPMS.git
  ```

### Step 3: Explore the Repository

#### Repository Structure:
- After cloning, you will see the `client` and `server` folders under the `IPMS` directory.

#### Open in Visual Studio Code:
- Open the `IPMS` folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

#### Install via npm:
- Open terminals for both `client` and `server` folders.
- Run the following command in each folder:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- After installation, a `node_modules` folder will appear in both `client` and `server` directories.

### Step 5: Run the Server

#### Start the Server:
- Navigate to the `server` folder and run:

  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

- This will start the server and connect to MongoDB.

---

### Step 6: Run the Client

#### Launch the Client Application:
- Navigate to the `client` folder and run:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
